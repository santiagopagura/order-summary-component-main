## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am still learning how to organize the code and how to use the tags correctly. This time I hesitated a lot whether to use the a or button tags. Otherwise I'm still taking a lot of time to take measurements and that's taking up my time. 

### Continued development

Eager to start taking on challenges with JavaScript but first to complete some more with CSS only.
